#  From Learning to Optimize to Learning Optimization Algorithms 
Code to reproduce the experiments from the paper [From Learning to Optimize to Learning Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18222), to appear at AISTATS 2025.

* Each ``main*.py`` file runs one of the experiments.
* The implementations of the models and running loops are stored in the [utils](https://github.com/camcastera/L2OtoLOA/tree/main/utils) folder.
* The pre-trained weights for the models of the learned algorithms are provided in the [Data](https://github.com/camcastera/L2OtoLOA/tree/main/Data) folder.
